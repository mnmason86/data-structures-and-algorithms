## Implementation Notes

## Code Challenges

### Code Challenge 05

Location: `codechallenges/linkedlist/LinkedListChallenges`

Methods:
`insert()` - Adds a new node with the given value to the head of the list.

`includes()` - Indicates whether the given value exists as a Node's value somewhere within the list.

`toString()` - (Override) Returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List

### Code Challenge 06

`append()` - Adds a node with the given value to the end of the Linked List.

`insertBefore()` - Inserts a node with the given new value to a position immediately before a node with the given existing value.

`insertAfter`() - Inserts a node with the given new value to a position immediately after a node with the given existing value.

`delete()` - Deletes a node with a given value from the Linked List.

### Code Challenge 07

`kthFromEnd()` - Finds the value of a Node that is k positions from the end of the list, where k is a given integer.

### Code Challenge 08

`zipLists()` - Takes in two Linked Lists, and returns a single Linked List with
the given Lists zipped together by alternating their nodes.
