# Hashmap

### Challenge Description

New implementation. Implement a hashmap class with the methods `set()`, `get()`,
`contains()`, `keys()`, and `hash()`.

### Methods with description

`set()`: Accepts a key and a value as arguments, no return. Hashes the key, and
sets the key/value pair into a hashmap.

`get()`: Accepts a key as an argument, and returns the associated value from the
hashmap.

`contains()`: Accepts a key as an argument, returns a boolean indicating if that
key exists in the hashmap.

`keys()`: Accepts no arguments, when called on a hashmap, returns a collection of
keys from that hashmap.

`hash()`: Accepts a key as an argument, returns the index of that key in the hashmap.
